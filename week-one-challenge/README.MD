The task this week was to refactor a webpage so it would be SEO and accesibilty-friendly. 

I added a title tag, meta description, favicon with alt text, and rel=canonical tag so search engines know htis is the original version of the page and the one that should be properly indexed. 

All the h1s, h2, and h3s are in proper order, so there was nothing to change there. Additionally, the alt tags for the images included apt descriptions, so there is nothing to refactor there from an SEO standpoint.
