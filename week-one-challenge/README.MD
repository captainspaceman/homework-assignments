This week's task was to refactor a web page to be SEO and accessibility-friendly. 

I added a title tag, meta description, favicon with alt text, and rel=canonical tag so search engines know that this is the original version of the page and the one that should be indexed appropriately. 

All the h1s, h2, and h3s are in proper order, so there was nothing to change there. Additionally, the alt tags for the images included accurate descriptions, so there is nothing to refactor there from an SEO standpoint.
